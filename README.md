* Braces should always be on the new line
* Every LINQ clause have to be put on new line
* Use only maximum one empty line beetween code

### Naming ###
* Every identifier must be named in english
* Classes, structures, delegates, interfaces, namespaces, events, properties and methods are in PascalCase
* Fields are in camelCase, they start with underscore (\_skillLevel)
* Local variables, arguments are in camelCase
* Don't use very short names that does not clearly imply meaning (exceptions: using (var sb = new StringBuilder()) or LINQ lambdas)
* Don't user very long names, they should not contain prepositions, conjunctions and similiar words (instead of numberOfPlayersThatAreOnline use onlinePlayersCount)
